# Contributing Rules

## Commits and Workflow
Commit names must be pertinent (no *commit1* or *committone*).  
All development must take place on the dev branch.  
The Master branch is for "production" ready versions of the project.  
When developing new features new branches must be created which then must be metged into the dev branch when the features are completed and fully tested.  
When you write a piece of code, you'd better test that code.

## Variables and Methods
Variable and Method names must be camelCase and they must be self-explanatory (not *a1*).
Variables must be declared at the beginning of a Method/Class (except for counter variables).

## Comments
Document everything with javadoc.  
Try to use as little comments as possibile by adapting the naming convention in the section above.
